# Amazon-product-reviews-crawler
used python, beautifulsoup and selenium to create Amazon product reviews crawler.
currently have two versions, the older one is for chrome and the newer on is for microsoft edge. 
require product html name and its product code in the search bar.
might add more automation such as self crawling products in the future (not require individual product name and code anymore ).
